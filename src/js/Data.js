    {biome: 'european forest', name: 'Brown bear', diet: 'omnivorous', conservationStatus: 'LC', population: '110 000', latin: 'Ursus arctos', photo: 'brown_bear.jpg', text: 'The brown bear is a large bear species found across Eurasia and North America. In North America, the populations of brown bears are called grizzly bears. It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less variable in size and slightly bigger on average. The brown bear\'s range includes parts of Russia, Central Asia, China, Canada, the United States, Hokkaido, Scandinavia, the Balkans, the Picos de Europa and the Carpathian region, especially Romania, Bulgaria, Iran, Anatolia and the Caucasus. The brown bear is recognized as a national and state animal in several European countries.' },
    {biome: 'european forest', name: 'Red fox', diet: 'omnivorous', conservationStatus: 'LC', population: 'no data', latin: 'Vulpes vulpes', photo: 'red_fox.jpg', text: 'The red fox is the largest of the true foxes and one of the most widely distributed members of the order Carnivora, being present across the entire Northern Hemisphere including most of North America, Europe and Asia, plus parts of North Africa. It is listed as least concern by the IUCN. Its range has increased alongside human expansion, having been introduced to Australia, where it is considered harmful to native mammals and bird populations. Due to its presence in Australia, it is included on the list of the "world\'s 100 worst invasive species".'},
    {biome: 'european forest', name: 'Wolf', diet: 'omnivorous', conservationStatus: 'LC', population: '300 000', latin: 'Canis lupus', photo: 'canis_lupus.jpg', text: 'The wolf, also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray wolves, as colloquially understood, comprise non-domestic/feral subspecies. The wolf is the largest extant member of Canidae, males averaging 40 kg (88 lb) and females 37 kg (82 lb). Wolves measure 105–160 cm (41–63 in) in length and 80–85 cm (31–33 in) at shoulder height. The wolf is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them.'},
    {biome: 'tropical forest', name: 'Western gorilla', diet: 'herbivorous', conservationStatus: 'CR', population: '120 000', latin: 'Gorilla gorilla', photo: 'western_gorilla.jpg', text: 'The western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) is a great ape—the type species as well as the most populous species of the genus Gorilla. Nearly all of the individuals of this taxon belong to the western lowland gorilla subspecies, whose population is approximately 95,000 individuals. Only 250 to 300 of the only other western gorilla subspecies, the Cross river gorilla, are thought to remain. Western gorillas are generally lighter colored than eastern gorillas. Western lowland gorillas have black, dark grey or dark brown-grey fur with a brownish forehead. Measurements of wild individuals show that mature males average 1.55 metres (5 ft 1 in) in height, while mature females average 1.35 metres (4 ft 5 in).'},
    {biome: 'tropical forest', name: 'Poison dart frog', diet: 'carnivorous', conservationStatus: 'EN', population: 'no data', latin: 'Dendrobatidae', photo: 'dart_frog.jpg', text: 'Poison dart frog is the common name of a group of frogs in the family Dendrobatidae which are native to tropical Central and South America. Their bright coloration is correlated with the toxicity of the species, making them aposematic. Some species of the family Dendrobatidae exhibit extremely bright coloration along with high toxicity, while others have cryptic coloration with minimal to no amount of observed toxicity.[3] The species that have great toxicity derive this from their diet of ants, mites and termites.[3][4] Other species however, that exhibit cryptic coloration and low to no amounts of toxicity, eat a much larger variety of prey.[4] Many species of this family are threatened due to human infrastructure encroaching on their habitats.

    {biome: 'tropical forest', name: 'Okapi', diet: 'herbivorous', conservationStatus: 'EN', population: 'no data', latin: 'Okapia johnstoni', photo: 'okapi.jpg', text: 'The okapi, also known as the forest giraffe, Congolese giraffe, or zebra giraffe, is an artiodactyl mammal native to the northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Central Africa. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources classifies the okapi as endangered. Major threats include habitat loss due to logging and human settlement. Although the okapi has striped markings reminiscent of zebras, it is most closely related to the giraffe. The okapi and the giraffe are the only living members of the family Giraffidae. Okapis are primarily diurnal, but may be active for a few hours in darkness. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. Okapis are herbivores, feeding on tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi.'}

    {biome: 'european forest', name: 'Scots pine', type: 'tree', foliage: 'needles', conservationStatus: 'LC', latin: 'Pinus sylvestris', photo: 'scots_pine.jpg', text: 'Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris, is a species of tree in the pine family Pinaceae that is native to Eurasia, ranging from Western Europe to Eastern Siberia, south to the Caucasus Mountains and Anatolia, and north to well inside the Arctic Circle in Fennoscandia. In the north of its range, it occurs from sea level to 1,000 m, while in the south of its range it is a mountain tree, growing at 1,200–2,600 m altitude. It is readily identified by its combination of fairly short, blue-green leaves and orange-red bark. The species is mainly found on poorer, sandy soils, rocky outcrops, peat bogs or close to the forest limit. On fertile sites, Scots pine is out-competed by other tree species, usually spruce or broad-leaved trees. It is the national tree of Scotland.'},
    {biome: 'european forest', name: 'Ginkgo biloba', type: 'tree', foliage: 'leaves', conservationStatus: 'EN', latin: 'Ginkgo biloba', photo: 'ginkgo_biloba.jpg', text: 'Ginkgo biloba, also known as the maidenhair tree, is the only living species in the division Ginkgophyta, all others being extinct. It is a member of a very old genus, with some fossils dating back 270 million years. Native to China, the tree is widely cultivated. It has various uses in traditional medicine and as a source of food. Ginkgos are large trees, normally reaching a height of 20–35 m, with some specimens in China being over 50 m. The tree has an angular crown and long, somewhat erratic branches, and is usually deep rooted and resistant to wind and snow damage. During autumn, the leaves turn a bright yellow, then fall. A combination of resistance to disease, insect-resistant wood and the ability to form aerial roots and sprouts makes ginkgos long-lived, with some specimens claimed to be more than 2,500 years old.'},
    {biome: 'european forest', name: 'Blackberry', type: 'bush', foliage: 'leaves', conservationStatus: 'LC', latin: 'Rubus plicatus', photo: 'blackberry.jpg', text: 'The blackberry is an edible fruit produced by many species in the genus Rubus in the family Rosaceae. What distinguishes the blackberry from its raspberry relatives is whether or not the torus (receptacle or stem) "picks with" (i.e., stays with) the fruit. When picking a blackberry fruit, the torus stays with the fruit. With a raspberry, the torus remains on the plant, leaving a hollow core in the raspberry fruit. Cultivated blackberries are notable for their significant contents of dietary fiber, vitamin C, and vitamin K (table).'},
    {biome: 'tropical forest', name: 'Bromeliad', type: 'herb', foliage: 'leaves', conservationStatus: 'LC', latin: 'Bromeliaceae', photo: 'bromeliad.jpg', text: 'Bromeliads are flowering plants whose long leaves are arranged in a rosette. They attach themselves to the host tree by wrapping their roots around its branches. Their leaves channel water into a central ‘tank’. A bromeliad’s tank is a habitat in itself. The water is used not only by the plant, but also by many rainforest animals. Birds and mammals drink from the tank. Tadpoles grow there, and insects lay their eggs in the pond.'},
    {biome: 'tropical forest', name: 'Orchids', type: 'herb', foliage: 'leaves', conservationStatus: 'LC', latin: 'Orchidaceae', photo: 'orchids.jpg', text: 'Orchids in the rainforest are often epiphytes. Some have specially adapted roots that enable them to capture water and nutrients from the air. Other orchids have roots that spread out over the branch of the host tree, capturing water without needing to bury into the ground. Orchids are easily distinguished from other plants, as they share some very evident derived characteristics or synapomorphies. Among these are: bilateral symmetry of the flower, many resupinate flowers, a nearly always highly modified petal (labellum), fused stamens and carpels, and extremely small seeds.'},
    {biome: 'tropical forest', name: 'Walking palm', type: 'tree', foliage: 'leaves', conservationStatus: 'LC', latin: 'Socratea exorrhiza', photo: 'walking_palm.jpg', text: 'Socratea exorrhiza, the walking palm or cashapona, is a palm native to rainforests in tropical Central and South America. It can grow to 25 metres in height, with a stem diameter of up to 16 cm,[1] but is more typically 15–20 m tall and 12 cm in diameter. It has unusual stilt roots, the function of which has been debated. Many species of epiphyte have been found growing on the palms. The palm is pollinated by beetles, and various organisms eat its seeds or seedlings.'}
